    <h1>Exercise 26:</h1>
    <b>Question:</b>
    <p>
        Prove that Sinz's clauses (18) and (19) enforce the cardinality constraint \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{n} \leq r\). 
        <i>Hint</i>: Show that they imply \(s_{j}^{k} = 1\) whenever \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{j+k-1} \geq k\).
    </p>

    <b>Proof:</b>
    <p>
        The Sinz's clauses are 
        \begin{gather}
        \left( \bar{s}_{j}^{k} \lor s_{j+1}^{k} \right), && \text{for \(1 \leq j \leq n-r\) and \(1 \leq k \leq r\)} \tag{18} \\
        \left( \bar{x}_{j+k} \lor \bar{s}_{j}^{k} \lor s_{j}^{k+1} \right), && \text{for \(1 \leq j \leq n-r\) and \(0 \leq k \leq r\)} \tag{19}
        \end{gather}
        , where \(\bar{s}_{j}^{k}\) is omitted when \(k = 0\) and \(s_{j}^{k+1}\) is omitted when \(k = r\).
        <br><br>

        First, we need to prove that (18), (19), and \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{j+k-1} \geq k\) imply \(s_{j}^{k} = 1\), and the proof
        follows the induction on \(j\) and \(k\). Let's start with \(j\).

        <br><br>
        The Base case for \(j\) is \(j = 1\). Thus, \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{j+k-1} \geq k\) becomes \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{k} \geq k\).
        Obviously, \(x_{1} = x_{2} = \cdots = x_{k} = 1\). If we let \(j = 1, k = 0\) in (19), we have \( \left( \bar{x}_{1} \lor s_{1}^{1} \right) \).
        Since \( x_{1} = 1\), \( s_{1}^{1}\) must be \(1\). Thus, we prove the base case.

        <br><br>
        Next we will prove the induction case. Assume we have \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{j+k-1} \geq k\) and \( s_{j}^{k} = 1\), we want to prove if \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{j+k} \geq k\),
        then \( s_{j+1}^{k} = 1\). Since \( s_{j}^{k} = 1\), by (18), \( s_{j+1}^{k} = 1\).

        <br><br>
        Next, we prove the case of \(k\). The base case is \(k = 1\), and \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{j} \geq 1\), which means at least
        one \(x_{i} = 1, i \in [1,j]\). If we let \(k = 0 \) in (19), we have \(\left( \bar{x}_{i} \lor s_{i}^{1} \right) \),
        thus \(s_{i}^{1} = 1\). By induction on \( j \), we have \(s_{i+1}^{1} = 1, \cdots, s_{j}^{1} = 1\). Thus we prove the base case.

        <br><br>
        For the induction case, if we have \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{j+k-1} \geq k\), \(s_{j}^{k} = 1\), and \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{j+k} \geq k+1\),
        we want to prove \(s_{j}^{k+1} = 1\). There can be two cases here. First, \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{j+k-1} = k\), then \(x_{j+k} = 1\).
        And \(s_{j}^{k+1} = 1\) by (19). Second, \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{j+k-1} \geq k+1\), thus \(s_{j-1}^{k+1} = 1\). And by induction on
        \(j\), we have \(s_{j}^{k+1} = 1\).

        <br><br>
        By far, we know that \(s_{j}^{k} = 1\) if \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{j+k-1} \geq k\). Thus, if \(s_{n-r}^{r} = 1\), then
        \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{n} \geq r\). And by definition of (18), we have \(\bar{s}_{n-r}^{r}\), which means \(s_{n-r}^{r} = 0\). Thus, 
        (18) and (19) assure \(x_{1} + \cdots + x_{j+k-1} < k\).
