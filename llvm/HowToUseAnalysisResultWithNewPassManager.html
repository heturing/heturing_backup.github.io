    <h1>How to use analysis result with new pass manager in LLVM</h1>

    <p>
        LLVM has recently moved from legacy pass manager to <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2021-03-26-the-new-pass-manager/">new pass manager</a>.
        However, there are only a few tutotials online that explains how to work with
        the new pass manager to write a pass. The official tutorials (<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/NewPassManager.html#using-the-new-pass-manager">using the new pass manager</a>
        and <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass.html#writing-an-llvm-pass">writing an llvm pass</a>) from LLVM gives
        a good start point, but it leaves a big gap for the reader who want to do more
        advanced analysis than a "Hello World" pass. In this post, I am going to cover
        how to use the analysis result by creating two passes - an analysis pass that count
        how many functions are in this module, and a readout pass that print the analysis result
        to stdout.
